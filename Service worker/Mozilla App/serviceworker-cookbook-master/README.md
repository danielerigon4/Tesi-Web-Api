It's online. It's offline. It's a Service Worker!

Service workers are a new technology to aid developers in:

	- creating realistic, reliable offline experiences
	- vastly improving performance when online
	- logically and dynamically caching files for any purpose

The ServiceWorker API, which has recently made its way into Firefox Developer Edition, will change the way web and mobile app developers make their websites fast and functional!

## What is in this cookbook?

This cookbook contains dozens of practical, detailed, and working examples of service worker usage.  These examples are for developers from beginner to expert and illustrate a number of APIs:
